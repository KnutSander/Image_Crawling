# Image Crawling
Week 1 and 2 was a mixture of work and obligatory meetings, which is the reason there was little development done in the first two weeks. It was a also a period with a lot of exploring and understanding of several of the packages and concepts used for web crawling in Python.

The resulting products were the following:
* *beautifulSoup_test.py* - A test class to understand how Beautiful Soup works.
* *getImages.py* - A class that takes a link as an argument, and outputs a list of images links and alternative text.
* *iterativeGetImages.py* - A class that does what the class mentioned above does, as well as finding links on the given page and exploring connected pages iterativly until a given number of pages has been searched.
