# Web_Crawling_Work
This is a repository of web crawling work I did while working with Dr. Shoaib Jameel and Senior Data Scientist Mozhgan Talebpour.
Below is a list of the different folders, and what they contain.

## Image Crawling
My first attempt at web crawling, specifically crawling to find image links.

## Topic Searching
Divides pictures from sports articles from The Independent into what type of sport it is

## Image Labeling
Labels images from The Independent based on the most common word in the article, after processing the text using Elasticsearch.
