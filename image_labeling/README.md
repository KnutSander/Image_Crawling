# Image_Labeling
The aim of this is to search through The Independent technology and science related news, and try to label the images in each article
Here I will attempt to label images based on the most common word in the article, after formatting and processing it through Elasticsearch.

## Notes
Only look at pictures if the page contains *.html*, any other pages are not news pages.
Maybe try to search through the archives, using Selenium.
